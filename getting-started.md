## Getting Started with the Updated Version

This version of Serenity Focus is built with Next.js. If you're interested in running the application locally, here's how to get started:

### Setup

The project is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), ensuring a smooth setup process. 

Before running the development server, you need to install the project dependencies. Since this project uses Bun for package management, ensure you have [`Bun installed`](https://bun.sh/) on your machine. Then, execute the following command in the project directory:

```bash
bun i
# or 
bun install 
```

After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the development server using:

```bash
bun dev
```

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
